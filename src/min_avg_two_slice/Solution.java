 * Solution for Codility lesson:
 * https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/5-prefix_sums/min_avg_two_slice/
 * 
 * Idea:
 * There is a theorem that states that: AVG[0]...A[N] cannot be less than AVG[0]...A[k] and AVG[k+1]...A[N].
 * A composed slice will never have an average sum lower than its components.
 * So, just look for slice with 2 or 3 elements having minimum average.
