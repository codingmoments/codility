 * Solution for Codility lesson:

 * 
 * Idea:
 * Calculate sum of all numbers in the array.
 * Start traversing the array.
 * In every iteration, calculate the sum of left side of the array.
 * Sum of the right side of the array will be total sum - left side sum.
 * Keep track of minimum difference between LHS and RHS.
